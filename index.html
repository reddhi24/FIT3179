These problems may involve armed conflict and war, natural disasters, pollution, poaching, or uncontrolled urbanisation or human development. This danger list is intended to increase international awareness of the threats and to encourage counteractive measures.This list is reviewed annually and sites are added or removed as they see fit. The graph along right side shows the number of sites that are in danger currently.
